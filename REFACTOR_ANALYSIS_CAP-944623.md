## What Needs to Happen Next

### Step 1: User Must Approve New Enablers

The user must review and approve the 4 new enabler specifications:

```
specifications/729481-enabler.md  (Authentication System)
specifications/836247-enabler.md  (Workspace Management)
specifications/942158-enabler.md  (Interactive Storyboard Canvas)
specifications/517389-enabler.md  (AI Chat Interface)
```

**Action Required**: Update each enabler metadata:
```markdown
- **Approval**: Pending  →  **Approval**: Approved
```

### Step 2: Update Capability Enablers Table

Once enablers are approved, update CAP-944623 to include new enablers:

```markdown
## Enablers

| Enabler ID | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| ENB-173294 | React Application Bootstrap |
| ENB-284951 | Ford Design System Integration |
| ENB-395762 | UI Routing and Navigation |
| ENB-486513 | Page Component Library |
| ENB-597324 | State Management System |
| ENB-648135 | Backend API Integration Layer |
| ENB-729481 | Authentication System (NEW) |
| ENB-836247 | Workspace Management (NEW) |
| ENB-942158 | Interactive Storyboard Canvas (NEW) |
| ENB-517389 | AI Chat Interface (NEW) |
```

### Step 3: Proceed with Design Phase

Once approved, follow CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
- Complete design for all enablers (approved ones only)
- Update existing enablers with refactored designs
- Create technical specifications

### Step 4: Implementation

Only after design phase complete:
- Implement authentication system
- Refactor navigation to sidebar
- Implement workspace management
- Build storyboard canvas with drag-and-drop
- Create AI chat interface
- Refactor existing pages to new design

## Design System Challenge

### 🎨 Design System Access Issue

**Problem**: Both Figma URLs require JavaScript to render:
- Mockup: https://rotate-jump-60911607.figma.site
- Design System: https://vest-hazel-54208462.figma.site

**Current Approach**:
The existing Ford Design System from `uploaded-assets/balut-design-system.html` has been used. However, the specification now references a different design system URL.

**Options**:
1. **Keep current Ford Design System** - Maintain consistency with existing implementation
2. **User provides design assets** - Export Figma designs as images/specs
3. **Generic professional design** - Create clean, professional UI without exact Figma match

**Recommendation**: Proceed with current Ford Design System unless user provides alternative design assets.

## Recommendation

### 🎯 **Next Action: User Decision Required**

**Option A: Approve New Enablers & Proceed**
1. User reviews 4 new enabler specifications
2. User updates Approval = "Approved" for desired enablers
3. I proceed with design and implementation

**Option B: Modify Requirements**
1. User clarifies specific requirements
2. User provides Figma design exports
3. Adjust enabler scope as needed

**Option C: Phased Approach**
1. Approve critical enablers first (Auth, Sidebar, Workspace)
2. Implement Phase 1
3. Approve remaining enablers later (Storyboard, AI Chat)
4. Implement Phase 2

## Compliance Statement

This analysis follows **SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md v3.0.1**:
- ✅ Verified approval status before proceeding
- ✅ Created minimal enabler specifications during analysis
- ✅ Did NOT modify approval statuses
- ✅ Did NOT proceed to implementation without approval
- ✅ Followed "Ready for Refactor" workflow (line 549-558)
- ✅ Set capability Status = "Ready for Refactor" (not changed)

**Workflow Status**: ⏸️ **AWAITING USER APPROVAL OF NEW ENABLERS**
