# ANALYSIS BLOCKER REPORT: CAP-944623 (display UI)

**Date**: November 13, 2025
**Status**: BLOCKED - Cannot Proceed with Analysis
**Capability**: CAP-944623 - display UI
**Current Phase**: Task 2 (Analysis)

---

## BLOCKER DESCRIPTION

### Issue
Cannot access the Figma design mockup required for UI implementation.

**Figma URL**: https://www.figma.com/design/f7cexaGHsYERSTNkPriC6L/Balut-Web-Platform-Design

**Error**: HTTP 403 Forbidden - The Figma file requires authentication

### Impact
The capability specification (CAP-944623) states:

> "The display UI will be based on the mockup that is found at https://www.figma.com/make/f7cexaGHsYERSTNkPriC6L/Balut-Web-Platform-Design?t=APmuh1XxwRvODipc&fullscreen=1. **This link will need to be very precisely reverse engineered** to create actual react.js code..."

Without access to the Figma mockup, I cannot:
1. Identify the specific screens/pages to build
2. Understand the layout and component hierarchy
3. Reverse engineer the exact UI structure
4. Create accurate React components matching the design
5. Generate proper enabler specifications

---

## REQUIRED TO UNBLOCK

### Option 1: Provide Figma Access
- Make the Figma file publicly accessible (view-only)
- OR provide the Figma file as exported images/screenshots
- OR export the Figma design as JSON/dev mode specs

### Option 2: Provide Alternative Design Specifications
- Provide screenshots or mockups of all UI screens
- Provide written UI specifications (pages, components, layouts)
- Provide wireframes or design documentation

### Option 3: Generic Implementation
- Build a generic React UI using the Ford Design System
- Create reasonable assumptions about the UI structure
- Implement common pages (Dashboard, Capability List, Design View, etc.)

---

## WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW

### Available Resources
✅ **Ford Design System** (balut-design-system.html) - Complete and accessible
- Full color palette
- Typography system
- Component library (buttons, cards, forms, alerts)
- Grid system
- Spacing and elevation guidelines
- Material Design foundation

### Partial Analysis Possible
I can create a **generic React UI capability** with standard enablers:
1. React Application Bootstrap
2. Design System Integration
3. Routing and Navigation
4. Page Components (generic structure)
5. Component Library
6. State Management

However, this would NOT meet the requirement for "very precisely reverse engineered" from the Figma mockup.

## RECOMMENDATION

**IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**:

1. **For Product Owner**: Provide access to the Figma design file
   - Share the Figma file with view permissions
   - OR export the design as images/specs
   - OR provide alternative design documentation

2. **For Development Team**: Clarify the approach
   - Should I proceed with a generic UI implementation?
   - Should I wait for Figma access?
   - What level of design fidelity is required?

## CURRENT STATE

### Capability Status
- **ID**: CAP-944623
- **Approval**: Approved ✅
- **Status**: In Analysis (BLOCKED ⚠️)
- **Analysis Review**: Required

### Dependencies
- **Design System**: Available ✅
- **Figma Mockup**: NOT Accessible ❌

## NEXT STEPS

**Waiting for**:
- [ ] Figma file access OR
- [ ] Alternative design specifications OR
- [ ] Direction to proceed with generic implementation

**Once unblocked**:
- [ ] Complete Analysis phase (create enablers)
- [ ] Proceed to Design phase
- [ ] Implement React UI
