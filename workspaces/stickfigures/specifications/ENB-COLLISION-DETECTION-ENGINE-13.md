# Collision Detection Engine

## Metadata
- **Type**: Enabler
- **Status**: Planned
- **Generated**: 12/1/2025, 9:57:34 AM

## Description
Process hit detection, boundary checking, and spatial collision calculations for combat interactions and stage boundaries

## Rationale
The Combat Engine mentions collision detection algorithms as external dependencies, and Arena Renderer references stage boundaries, but there's no dedicated collision detection system to handle these critical game mechanics.

## Implementation Notes
_Add implementation details here._

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TODO: Define acceptance criteria
