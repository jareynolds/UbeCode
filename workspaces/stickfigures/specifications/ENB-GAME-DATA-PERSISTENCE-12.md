## Description
Save and load game configurations, player preferences, high scores, and character customizations using local storage or cloud saves

## Rationale
The Player State Manager references 'potential localStorage for session persistence' and character customizations need to be saved, but there's no dedicated enabler for data persistence functionality.

## Implementation Notes
_Add implementation details here._

## Acceptance Criteria
