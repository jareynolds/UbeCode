## Key Findings

### Current State
```
✓ Authentication: JWT-based, 5 roles available
✓ Authorization: RoleAccessContext with page-level RBAC
✓ Database: PostgreSQL with established schema
✓ Backend: Go microservices with repository pattern
✓ Frontend: React with Context API for state management
✗ Approval Workflow: Does NOT exist
```

### What Needs to be Built
```
Database:
  - capability_approvals table (new)
  - approval_workflow_rules table (new)

Backend (Go):
  - pkg/models/approval.go (new)
  - pkg/repository/approval_repository.go (new)
  - API endpoints for approval operations
  - Auth middleware and permission checks

Frontend (React):
  - ApprovalContext (new)
  - approvalService API client (new)
  - 4 new UI components
  - 2 component updates
```

## Quick Reference

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Database & Models)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2 (Backend API)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 3 (Frontend Infrastructure)**: 1-2 hours
- **Phase 4 (Frontend UI)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 5 (Testing & Polish)**: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: ~14.5 hours

### Approval Workflow
```
Created → Request → Pending → [Approve → Approved] OR [Reject → Rejected]
                                ↑
                        Can Withdraw from here
```

### Permission Model
```
Role              Can Request  Can Approve  Can Reject
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
admin              YES          YES          YES
product_owner      YES          YES          YES
designer           YES          NO           NO
engineer           YES          NO           NO
devops             YES          NO           NO
```

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Use separate table** for capability_approvals (allows approval history)
2. **Role-based permissions** (simpler than user-specific)
3. **Lock editing during approval** (prevent mid-approval changes)
4. **Include audit trail** (track all approval decisions)
5. **Leverage existing RoleAccessContext** (no reinventing auth)
6. **Add database indexes** (performance on large datasets)

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start simple**: Binary approval model (pending/approved/rejected)
2. **Use existing patterns**: Follow capability_repository design
3. **Leverage auth system**: Use existing JWT claims and roles
4. **Build incrementally**: Database → Backend → Frontend
5. **Test thoroughly**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests

## Files to Review

In Balut repository:
- `cmd/capability-service/main.go` - HTTP handler pattern
- `pkg/repository/capability_repository.go` - Repository pattern
- `web-ui/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Context API pattern
- `web-ui/src/context/RoleAccessContext.tsx` - RBAC implementation
- `internal/auth/service.go` - JWT implementation

## Key Metrics

| Aspect | Current | With Approval |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Capability Service Endpoints | 6 | 12 |
| Database Tables | 4 | 6 |
| React Components | 2 | 8 |
| Models/Structs | 3 | 6 |
| Lines of Code (Backend) | ~250 | ~650 |
| Lines of Code (Frontend) | ~1,300 | ~2,000 |

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence** (do in this order):
1. Create database tables (migration script)
2. Create approval.go models
3. Create approval_repository.go
4. Add approval endpoints to capability service
5. Create ApprovalContext
6. Create approvalService
7. Build UI components
8. Update existing components
9. Add tests
10. Polish and deploy

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Race conditions | Low | High | Use transactions, locking |
| Approval hangs | Low | Medium | Add timeout, admin override |
| UI confusion | Medium | Medium | Clear status, good UX |
| Performance issues | Low | Medium | Indexes, pagination, caching |
| Permission bypass | Low | High | Server-side validation |

## Next Steps

1. Review APPROVAL_WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md for detailed specifications
2. Review APPROVAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for day-to-day guidance
3. Start with Phase 1: Database schema design
4. Create migration script
5. Begin implementation in recommended order

## Questions to Consider

- Should file-based capabilities also require approval? (Currently supports specs/ folder)
- Need email notifications when approval requested/decided?
- Need real-time WebSocket updates for approvers?
- Should rejected capabilities require re-approval or just editing?
- Need approval audit logs for compliance?
- Performance requirements (expected capability count)?

## Conclusion

The Balut codebase is **well-architected and ready** for approval workflow implementation. With existing auth, RBAC, and data patterns established, adding approval workflow is **straightforward and low-risk**.

**Estimated delivery time**: 2-3 weeks with standard development practices (design, code, test, review).
